## Task 1: Campaign Concept Generation (45 mins)
**Tool:** ChatGPT

### Scenario
Guerilla has been briefed to create a disruptive social media campaign for a new energy drink brand launching in South Africa. The brand is targeting Gen Z (18-25 year olds) and wants to position itself as the drink for "creators and rebels."

### Your Assignment

**Step 1:** Use ChatGPT to generate campaign concepts.

**Prompt Template** (customize as you see fit):
```
Act as a senior creative strategist at an anti-traditional creative 
agency in South Africa. 

Our client is launching a new energy drink targeting Gen Z creators 
and rebels (18-25 years old) in South Africa. The drink is called 
[make up a name].

Generate 5 disruptive social media campaign concepts that would make 
this brand stand out. Each concept should include:
- Campaign name/tagline
- Core idea (2-3 sentences)
- 3 example content ideas for Instagram/TikTok
- Why it would resonate with Gen Z SA audience

Be bold, anti-traditional, and avoid generic energy drink clichés.
```

**Step 2:** Review the 5 concepts ChatGPT generates.

**Step 3:** Pick your favorite concept and ask ChatGPT to expand it:
```
I love concept #[number]. Generate 10 specific Instagram/TikTok post 
ideas for this campaign. For each, describe:
- The visual/video concept
- The caption/hook
- Why it would stop the scroll
```

### Deliverable
- Copy-paste your best 3 post ideas into your homework doc
- Note which ones felt genuinely creative vs. generic

## Task 2: Competitive Research (30 mins)
**Tool:** Perplexity

### Scenario
A potential automotive client wants to understand how competitors are using innovative technology (like AR, VR, AI) in their marketing campaigns globally.

### Your Assignment

**Step 1:** Use Perplexity to research this topic.

**Query 1:**
```
What are 5 examples of automotive brands using AR (augmented reality) 
in their marketing campaigns from 2024-2026? Include specific campaign 
names and what they did.
```

**Query 2:**
```
How are automotive brands in South Africa specifically using digital 
innovation in their marketing? Any AR, AI, or interactive campaigns?
```

**Query 3:**
```
What is the Toyota Urban Cruiser, and what marketing tactics did 
Toyota use to launch it in South Africa?
```

**Step 2:** Review the responses and notice how Perplexity provides sources.

### Deliverable
- Summarize findings in 200 words
- List 3 specific campaigns you could reference in a pitch
- Note: Did Perplexity provide reliable sources? Did any answers feel incomplete?

---

## Task 3: Brand Voice Consistency Test (45 mins)
**Tool:** Claude OR Gemini (your choice)

### Scenario
Test whether AI can capture and maintain Guerilla's distinctive brand voice—bold, anti-traditional, irreverent but professional.

### Your Assignment

**Step 1:** Analyze Guerilla's voice.

Visit [guerilla.africa](https://guerilla.africa) and copy 2-3 paragraphs of their website copy.

**Step 2:** Feed this to your chosen AI tool (Claude or Gemini).

**Prompt:**
```
I'm going to share some website copy from Guerilla, a creative agency 
in South Africa. Analyze their brand voice and tone.

[Paste Guerilla website copy here]

Based on this, describe their:
1. Tone (formal? casual? edgy?)
2. Personality traits
3. What kind of language they use (and avoid)
4. Key phrases or patterns you notice
```

**Step 3:** Ask the AI to write in that voice.

**Prompt:**
```
Now, using the same voice and tone, write 3 Instagram posts 
announcing that Guerilla has just won an award for "Best Use of 
AR in Advertising." Each post should be 2-3 sentences, bold and 
anti-traditional like Guerilla's style.
```

**Step 4:** Evaluate the results.

- Do the AI-generated posts sound like Guerilla?
- What did it get right?
- What feels off?

### Deliverable
- Include the 3 AI-generated posts
- Rate each post 1-10 for "how Guerilla does it sound?"
- Note: Which AI (Claude or Gemini) did you use?

---

## Task 4: Tool Comparison Reflection (30 mins)
**Tools:** All three (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude/Gemini)

### Your Assignment

Now that you've used all three tools, answer these reflection questions:

**1. Speed & Ease of Use**
- Which tool felt most intuitive to use?
- Which gave the fastest useful responses?

**2. Creative Quality**
- Which tool produced the most creative/surprising output?
- Which felt most "generic" or predictable?

**3. Accuracy & Reliability**
- Which tool felt most trustworthy for factual information?
- Did any tool "hallucinate" or give questionable info?

**4. Guerilla Applications**
- For client brainstorming sessions, which would you use?
- For researching a new client's industry, which would you use?
- For writing a strategy document, which would you use?

**5. Limitations**
- Where did you clearly see AI struggle?
- What tasks would you NOT trust AI to do alone?

### Deliverable
Write 300-500 words answering these questions based on your experience.

## Bonus Challenge (Optional)

### Scenario
You've just finished a client call for a new DStv campaign. The client spoke for 45 minutes covering:
- Target audience (young professionals, 25-35)
- Key message (DStv brings world-class entertainment to SA homes)
- Deliverables needed (billboards, social campaign, radio spots)
- Timeline (6 weeks)
- Budget (R500,000)

### Your Task
Use **ChatGPT** to create a creative brief document from your "notes" (make up realistic details).

**Prompt:**
```
Act as an account manager at a creative agency. Based on these client 
meeting notes [write your made-up notes], create a formal creative 
brief in this format:

1. Client & Project Overview
2. Objectives
3. Target Audience
4. Key Message
5. Deliverables
6. Timeline & Budget
7. Tone & Style Guidelines
8. Success Metrics

Make it professional, concise, and actionable for the creative team.
```

**Bonus Deliverable:**
- Share the AI-generated brief
- Note: How much editing did it need? Would you send this to a client?

---

## Submission Guidelines

**What to Submit:**
Create a single document (Google Doc, Word, or even Slack message) with:
1. Task 1: Your top 3 campaign post ideas
2. Task 2: Competitive research summary (200 words)
3. Task 3: The 3 Guerilla-voice Instagram posts + ratings
4. Task 4: Reflection answers (300-500 words)
5. Bonus (optional): Creative brief

**Where to Submit:**
[Add your submission method: Email to trainer, Slack channel, shared folder, etc.]

**Grading:**
This is about learning, not perfection. You'll get full credit for:
- Completing all 4 tasks
- Thoughtful reflection (not just "it was good")
- Honest assessment of what worked and what didn't

---

## Tips for Success

🚀 **Don't aim for perfect prompts** - Your first prompt often won't work perfectly. Iterate!

🎯 **Be specific** - Vague prompts = vague results. Include context, constraints, format.

🔄 **Iterate** - If output is bad, refine your prompt. Try adding: "Be more [specific/creative/bold]"

🤔 **Think critically** - AI will confidently say wrong things. Always fact-check important claims.

⏱️ **Track your time** - Notice how long each task takes. Could you do this faster without AI? Slower?

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Problem:** ChatGPT responses are too generic/safe.
→ **Solution:** Add to prompt: "Avoid clichés. Be bold and unexpected."

**Problem:** Perplexity doesn't find South African-specific info.
→ **Solution:** Add "in South Africa" explicitly to every query.

**Problem:** Claude/Gemini can't capture Guerilla's voice.
→ **Solution:** Provide MORE example text. 2-3 paragraphs might not be enough. Try adding 5-10 examples.

**Problem:** AI gives different results each time.
→ **Solution:** That's expected! AI is non-deterministic. Pick the best output from multiple runs.
