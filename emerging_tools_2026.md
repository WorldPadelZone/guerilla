- ⚠️ **Length:** Most tools max out at 10-second clips (stitching required for longer)
- ⚠️ **Control:** Less precise control than traditional video editing
- ⚠️ **Cost:** Credits/usage limits can add up quickly for heavy use

**Recommendation for Guerilla:**
- Use AI video for **concepting and mockups** in 2026
- Not yet ready to replace traditional video production for major campaigns
- Excellent for social content, internal comms, rapid testing

| **Writesonic + Botsonic** | Chatbots for client websites | Build AI chatbots trained on client content | Free tier | $19/mo |

### New Focus: AI Performance Prediction

**Anyword's 2026 Superpower:**

**Guerilla Use Case:**
```
Scenario: Toyota campaign, 20 headline options

Old Way:
- Test all 20 in small budget ($5k)

- Scale top 3 winners

Anyword Way:
- Score all 20 with AI (5 mins)
- Test only top 5 predicted winners ($1.5k)

```

**Caveat:** AI predictions aren't perfect—but they're data-informed shortcuts.

## What NOT to Adopt (Yet)

### Tools to Skip in 2026

**❌ General AI Music Generators (Suno, Udio)**
- **Why Skip:** Licensing unclear, quality inconsistent, limited SA music styles
- **When to Revisit:** 2027 when licensing is clearer

**❌ AI 3D Modeling (Luma AI, Meshy)**
- **Why Skip:** Still early, limited practical use for 2D agency work
- **When to Revisit:** If you start doing more AR/3D work

**❌ AI Coding Assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor)**
- **Why Skip:** Not relevant for non-technical marketers
- **Exception:** If you have dev team, they should use these

**❌ Enterprise AI Platforms (IBM Watson, Salesforce Einstein)**
- **Why Skip:** Overkill for agency size, expensive, complex setup
- **When to Revisit:** If managing Fortune 500 clients with complex data needs
